# Project Feedback + Evaluation

Good job on Project 1.  A good, solid project.  You kept it simple and maintainable.

## Project Workflow:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?


**Exceeds expectations:**
Nice readme.  "Approach Taken" sounds like  winner.  I hope it worked well for you.  This is a great example of pseudocode.  It shows that you have an obvious understanding of what is required.  Good job with many, small commits with good descriptions. I hope your User Stories were helpful too, they were prioritized well, to ensure you made step-by-step progression.

The file extension on your readme (.md) indicates that it is formatted using markdown.  Github will automatically parse markdown to html prior to rendering.  Check it out: https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/


## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations:**
You did what was required, coding and deploying a web application.


## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations:**
You code has decent organization and uses semantic names.  Good job grouping your code into methods, it's pretty self-documenting.  You have quite a bit of commented out code.  It would be better to put new ideas in branches and keep "master" clean.  There is some obvious duplication (playerOneHand, playerTwoHand).  How can we group all the player information together?

Make sure to take a look at the inline code comments I made in this [pull request](https://github.com/mkernsNCR/project-war/pull/1).

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets requirements:**
I would like to hear some more about your unsolved problem.  See below.

## Unsolved Problems

> I was not able to code out the "I, De,-clare, War" portion of the game. I will revisit that functionality after further research. =D

I would like to hear some more.  What have you done?  Pseudocode?  How close is it to supporting this?  What needs to change?
